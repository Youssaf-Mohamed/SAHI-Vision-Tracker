# SAHI Vision Tracker

## Overview
This project is a computer vision application that efficiently detects and counts objects in real time. Utilizing YOLO for object detection and the SAHI algorithm for detecting small objects, it performs object detection without requiring predefined areas, making it adaptable to various environments.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- YOLO (You Only Look Once)
- SAHI (Slicing Aided Hyper Inference)
- NumPy

## Features
- **Real-Time Detection**: Detects objects in video feeds as they appear without needing predefined boundaries.
- **Small Object Detection**: Utilizes the SAHI algorithm for enhanced detection of small objects.
- **User-Friendly Visualization**: Displays detected objects in real-time with bounding boxes.

## Usage Guide
